# Platform as Prompt

Experimental project for investigating:

- A new paradigm, PaP (Platform as Prompts), can software architects describe good enough an entire platform for production mode?
- Can PaP reduce by ten the numbers of engineers to keep a platform running?
- Do we need new software patterns
- Is it good enough to support iterative design, additions and modificationsÂ¿
- Can it support monitoring and debugging?
