As a senior golang engineer, write a production-ready gRPC API service that implements the service described in the file `hello.proto` that has the following content:

``` /**
 * Hello World API service
 *
 * Just an experimenting API that will ping what you send
 */
syntax = "proto3";

package hello;
 
option go_package = "github.com/osangenis/hello";

message PingRequest {
  string in = 1;
}

message PingResponse {
  string out = 1;
}
  
// Hello Service
service HelloService {
  // Returns the same string that was sent
  rpc Ping(PingRequest) returns (PingResponse);
}
    ```

The service main file must be named `main.go` under the folder `cmd`, with the package name `main`.
Each service method must be implemented in its own file, under the folder `hello`, with the package name `hello` and filename as the method name.
The service must be able to be run with the command `go run hello.go`.
The service should listen on port 8080 if the environment variable `PORT` is not defined. Otherwise should run in the port defined by the environment variable `PORT`

You have to comply with the following requirements:
- Add source code comments
- File names must be in snake case
- Don't include any explanations in your responses
