As a senior golang engineer, write a gRPC API service that implements the service described in the file `hello.proto` that has the following content:

``` /**
 * Hello World API service
 *
 * Just an experimenting API that will ping what you send
 */
 syntax = "proto3";

 package hello;
 
 option go_package = "github.com/osangenis/hello";

  
 // Hello Service
 service HelloService {
   // Returns the same string that was sent
   rpc Ping(string) returns (string);
 }
    ```

The service must be implemented in the file `hello.go`.
The service must be able to be run with the command `go run hello.go`.
The service should listen on port 8080 if the environment variable `PORT` is not defined. Otherwise should run in the port defined by the environment variable `PORT`
